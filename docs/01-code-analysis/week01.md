## Week 1: Code Analysis.

> “Most, if not all developers spend their day reading codes”

[Exercice pour java complété](../../exercise/java/week01-code-analysis/exercise/readme.md)

### Daily job

As developers, we spend a lot of time reading code (some research suggest about 2/3 or our time), and as such, we polished our own set of tools to be able to navigate the intricate nature of the several code base we work on.

```java
     val ret = false;  //the value is always false
     return ret;
```

### Psychological bias

We have also developed bias towards reading codes especially code that is not ours. The first week will be spent reading a huge code base and analyzing the code. 

Reading objectively and not taking immediate actions can be the key to safe refactoring.
